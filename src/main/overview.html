QuickServer is an open source Java library/framework for quick creation 
of robust multi-client TCP server applications. With QuickServer you can 
concentrate on just the application logic/protocol on hand.  
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
QuickServer provides an abstraction over the ServerSocket, Socket and 
other network and input output classes and it eases the creation of 
powerful network servers.

Example programs demonstrating the use of the library can be found 
with the QuickServer distribution  [examples folder]. 
Latest examples, documentation is available through the <a href="http://www.quickserver.org">website</a>.

Brief Architecture<br>
---------------------<br>
QuickServer divides the application logic of its developer over eight 
main classes,
<br>
	<ul>
		<li>{@link org.quickserver.net.server.ClientEventHandler} [Optional Class]<br>
		   &nbsp;Handles client events.
		<li>{@link org.quickserver.net.server.ClientCommandHandler} [#]<br>
		   &nbsp;Handles client interaction - Character/String commands.
		<li>{@link org.quickserver.net.server.ClientBinaryHandler} [#]<br>
		   &nbsp;Handles client interaction - Binary data.
		<li>{@link org.quickserver.net.server.ClientObjectHandler} [#]<br>
		   &nbsp;Handles client interaction - Java Object commands.
		<li>{@link org.quickserver.net.server.ClientWriteHandler} [Optional Class]<br>
		   &nbsp;Handles client write operation - Non-Blocking Mode.		
		<li>{@link org.quickserver.net.server.ClientAuthenticationHandler} [Optional Class]<br>
			&nbsp;Used to Authenticate a client.
		<li>{@link org.quickserver.net.server.ClientData} [Optional Class]<br>
			&nbsp;Client data carrier (support class)
		<li>{@link org.quickserver.net.server.ClientExtendedEventHandler} [Optional Class]<br>
			&nbsp;Handles extended client events.
	</ul>
 
<p>
 [#] = Any one of these have to be set based on default DataMode for input. 
 The default DataMode for input is String so if not changes you will
 have to set ClientCommandHandler.

Major Features<br />
---------------------<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Create multi-client TCP server applications.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for secure server creations: SSL, TLS. {@link org.quickserver.util.xmlreader.Secure}<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for thread per client (multi-threaded) - Blocking Mode.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for non-blocking input output - Non-Blocking Mode.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Clear separation of server, protocol and authentication logic.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Remote administration support: {@link org.quickserver.net.qsadmin.QSAdminServer} (With support plugable application commands).<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Command Shell for local administration of server. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link org.quickserver.net.qsadmin.QSAdminServer#setShellEnable}<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* GUI based remote administration: QsAdminGUI (with support for plug-ins - {@link org.quickserver.net.qsadmin.gui.PluginPanel})<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Restart or Suspend the server without killing connected clients.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Inbuilt pools for reusing of threads and most used Objects.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Full logging support [Java built in Logging].<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for sending and receiving Strings, Bytes, Binary and serialized java objects.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for identifying and searching a client. {@link org.quickserver.net.server.ClientIdentifiable}<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for xml configuration with ability to store application specific 
   data in the same xml. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<a href="XMLConfiguration.xml">View Sample</a>]<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for xml Based JDBC Mapping - {@link org.quickserver.sql.DBPoolUtil}.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for Service Configurator pattern. {@link org.quickserver.net.Service}<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for restricting access to server by ip address.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for loading/reloading application jar from xml.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Ability to add process hooks into QuickServer. {@link org.quickserver.net.ServerHook}, {@link org.quickserver.net.InitServerHook}<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Ability to specify maximum number of clients allowed.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Support for negotiating secure connection over normal tcp connection.<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;* Nice easy examples come with the distribution - FTPServer, CmdServer, EchoWebServer, ChatServer, SecureEchoWebServer, XmlAdder, PipeServer, Filesrv.<br />
